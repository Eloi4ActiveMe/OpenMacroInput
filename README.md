# OMI : Open Macro Input
## Introduction
Macro' and Combo'' are the way of the professionnant.
It is the must for maximum efficiency.

But I realiazed that we are lacking of way to configure and trigger them.
That the aim of this project.

Open the ways of trigger tasks and actions in your everyday professional life.

The people that I want to help are mainly:
- 2D & 3D artists: Photoshop, Illustrator, Blender, 3D'sMax...
- architect software users: Fusion, SketchUp, Cad...
- video game professional players
- casual game that want more
_But the list is not exhaustive at all :) as you can guess_ 

The origine of this project is to help me to create tools for a member of my familly that has pain when using their hands.
So I big party of this project are also aiming to help people that are not able to use properly their keyboard and mouse but must.
Feel free to contact me, if you need specific patch of the tool(s) for your situation. 

_Macro' = Automated tasks of actions following one an other._
_Combo'' = combinaision of input that trigger and action(s)._

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BIG WARNING CLAIM ‚ö†Ô∏è
My tool is illegal!   
To work correctly, the tool require to read you keyboard input.   

That one of the reason why my code is 100% opensource for the community to check if I am not using you.     
Avast and window consider that it is usualy a virus way to work.    
So you will have to deal with it if you have anti-virus tool.  


#### Developer Warning
- All my code are open source but I am not coding for a community to work it. But for the community to know how I did it, and how they can do it themself.
  - Feel free to put your hand in the dirt and take what you need.
  - You can use it as you will but I don't want to spend 80% of my time beeing worry that I can fuck up the code of someone else when I modify it. So when you clone my tools, keep the commit id for your project.
