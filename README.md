> Until 2023 the license of this tool is not defined and so I keep all right reserved on the tool and the code.
> My plan is to find a way to make it opensource and free without side effect on the community.
> The software is in pay for the last upgrade until 2025 where I will decide of the license to use.  
   
Hope you enjoy my tools, May the code be with you 🤘
