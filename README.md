Before we start ‚ö†Ô∏è BIG WARNING CLAIM ‚ö†Ô∏è. 
- This tools is reading you keyboard and mouse to assist you. If you don't trust me, don't use my application.

- If you use an application from someone using my code, if you don't trust them, don't use their application.
  - This project is open source meaning that anybody can do they own version. I am not responsible of their illigale actions.
- This code is in development and as I don't have the budjet or the skills for hacker protection. Don't expect hacker protection. You are on your own if someone hack my tool to kack your computer. 

**Why I am so thrustfulon the subject?**
My tool is very powerfull and useful. And I know it. But I aware that it is also *very very very dangerous* as it allows hacker that want to harm you to hack you very powerfully.

And that said, good exploration of this tool :).


### Developer Warning

Current license of use:
```
There are none.
I wait to know how to write one be able to hire it.
Or I wait to hire a lawyer to write one that translate my way to see the project before proposing one.
So, for the moment, feel free to use it like you want but not-commercialy and consider that I am not responsible of any bug or maintaining until future official license.
Feel free to enjoy it for fun :)
```

- All my code are open source... But I am not assuming at all bug and malfunction.  
- You are not suppose to `fork` >-> `use` . You are suppose to `fork` >-> `make it your own` >-> `use`.  

- I am not coding to have a community using it. I am coding for me but I let the commmunity using it. 
  - Meaning, that I accept people working with me on it but I don't want to spend to much time doing that.
    -  I plan to have several points where you can hook your wook on mine. If you see better ways to do it contact and work with me to add them. Less people need me, more we are are happy.
  - Meaning, that my time of work are:
    - 75% working on innovation and adding code
    - 15% refactoring and keeping the code as clean as I can
    - 10% other stuffs: documenting, communicating, maintenaing ...
  - Meaning, that if you want me to code something, the best way is to make me want to code it by talking to me about it on vocal discord.
